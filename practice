With a screen eidtor you can scroll the page and move the cursor.(this line is jointed using shift j)
Ok I used :set number to set numbers on the left, so .I deleted stuff from "everything" to the bottom where my cursor is and you don' know.
I repeated /deleted using n to go down, and N to go up.
I use fx and find next x in the line, Fx to find the previous x in the line.
